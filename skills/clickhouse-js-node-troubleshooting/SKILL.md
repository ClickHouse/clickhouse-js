  Troubleshoot and resolve common issues with the ClickHouse Node.js client
  (@clickhouse/client). Use this skill whenever a user reports errors, unexpected
  behavior, or configuration questions involving the Node.js client specifically —
  including socket hang-up errors, Keep-Alive problems, stream handling issues, data
  type mismatches, read-only user restrictions, proxy/TLS setup problems, or long-running
  query timeouts. Trigger even when the user hasn't precisely named the issue; vague
  symptoms like "my inserts keep failing" or "connection drops randomly" in a Node.js
  context are strong signals to use this skill. Do NOT use for browser/Web client issues.

# ClickHouse Node.js Client Troubleshooting

Reference: https://clickhouse.com/docs/integrations/javascript

> **⚠️ Node.js only.** This skill covers the `@clickhouse/client` package exclusively. If the user is running the ClickHouse JS client in a browser or Web Worker environment, do not use this skill — a dedicated Web client troubleshooting skill should be used instead.

## How to Use This Skill

1. **Identify the issue** — match symptoms to the Issue Index below and read the corresponding reference file.
2. **Lead with the diagnosis** — explain what's likely causing the issue before giving the fix.
3. **Note version constraints** — flag if a fix requires a minimum client version and check it against what the user provided.
4. **Ask only what's missing** — if the fix is version-dependent and you don't know their version, ask; otherwise help immediately.
